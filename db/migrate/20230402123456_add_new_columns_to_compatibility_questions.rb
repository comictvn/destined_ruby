class AddNewColumnsToCompatibilityQuestions < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def change
    # Assuming the task is to add new columns to the compatibility_questions table
    # The specific column types are not provided in the "# TABLE" section, so I'll use common types
    # Replace `:string` or `:integer` with the correct types if they are known

    # Add new columns
    add_column :compatibility_questions, :question_text, :text
    add_column :compatibility_questions, :created_at, :datetime, null: false
    add_column :compatibility_questions, :updated_at, :datetime, null: false

    # Since the id column is typically created by default with the `create_table` method,
    # and it's not common to add it via a migration, it's not included here.
    # If the id column does not exist, uncomment the following line:
    # add_column :compatibility_questions, :id, :bigint, null: false, primary_key: true

    # Add indexes if necessary
    # For example, if question_text needs to be unique:
    # add_index :compatibility_questions, :question_text, unique: true
  end
